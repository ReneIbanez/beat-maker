  What inspired me to write the beat machine:
Iv been inspired by music since I was a kid. As I grew up as a teen, I started to get into recording music. As years went by I noticed that not only do I love to write, but I also had an ear for sound. So I thought to myself "wouldn't it be nice if I had my own beat machine to record for myself", so I did not have to pay for studio time anymore.

  What language did you use:
I used JavaScript to help me create a beat machine. Used Global variables to help me set BPM(''beats per min'').  Setting up functional programmed event listeners for my keyboard to respond, when keydown events are triggered. Creating a user friendly beat maker that lets you select different settings for the user to switch keyboard setting.
I Made multiple categories for the user to select , from making a file that had a “lil bit of everything” which shared a bunch of different sounds and different more specific categories based on which instrument is being used(“piano”,”hi-hat”,”kicker”,”bass”).   

Features:

you can set the metronome from 60 BPM to 100 BPM or more.
you can change files and alter the keyboard layout for different sounds
you can also select the sounds and place them in the metronome to play with the BPM settings
```
